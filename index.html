    <h1>Biography</h1><br>
    <p>Chardonnay believes storytelling and civic engagement invokes connection and empathy, promoting measurable progress and social good. She’s spent the entirety of her professional life amplifying the stories of minoritized groups.
    ​
    Chardonnay began public speaking at community gatherings at the age of 12. Since then, she’s hosted panels, facilitated interviews, engaged audiences as a keynote speaker, and more. Some of those platforms include, but aren’t limited to: Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI), Converge Media, YWCA Women of Achievement Awards, Blacks at Microsoft, and Justice for Girls.
    ​
    Her articles have been featured in Cascade PBS, The Emerald, and The Seattle Medium — to name a few. Her short and long-form feature stories unpack history and Black culture in a nuanced way. Chardonnay was recently nominated and awarded the University of Washington Fred Baker Ethics Award for outstanding storytelling in facilitating greater community engagement in media. 
    ​
    Her Instagram page turned column Words of Wisdom (WOW) by Char, published weekly in the Facts Newspaper since 2019, unpacks topics relating to authenticity, purpose, and faith. After four years of writing her column, Chardonnay has self-published her first book titled "Words of Wisdom: A Compilation of Life Principles, Inspired by Truth & Guided by Purpose Volume 1." Her book includes personal journal entries, published column articles, and aspirations that center Chardonnay's pursuit of purpose & destiny.  
    ​
    She’s developed two podcasts and in-depth interview specials. More Than An Athlete, one of her independent projects, is a vodcast she produced, edited, and arranged. Each episode features interviews with division one athletes discussing their significance beyond their performance. 

    Discover the captivating journey of resilience and redemption in Chardonnay's latest documentary, "Fulfill the Promise." Witness the inspiring tale of Seattle's first Black community economic development institute, SOIC, as it rises, falls, and ultimately fulfills its destiny. At its heart lies the story of Rev. Dr. Samuel Berry McKinney's vision, and the unwavering commitment of Seattle's Black leaders to reclaim ownership of the facility amidst financial adversity. Witness the community's triumph as they breathe new life into the building, now proudly named the McKinney Center for Community & Economic Development.
    ​
    Though her early career has been thrilling, all of her projects boil down to one truth: Chardonnay values people.
